# CPP_CA1
Welcome to my C++ CA1 project in Dundalk Institute of Technology. 
I have developed a school database system that allows a user to login,
add, update, delete and search through school groups. I took advantage of 
various data structures such as maps, vectors, sets, stacks and priority queues
for different tasks. For example I used a set to store a permenant record of students (past and present)
that would be appended to a text file. I used a priority queue to display the top 
scoring students in the database. A stack to display user history such as added students and deletion.
I took advantage of c++ features such as operator overloading to make my code less verbose and 
lambda functions for sorting. Other extra features include a generated html page that will display all current
students and teacher. Display of correlation coefficient between that uses template methods to cut down on code lines
without slowing down compiler speed. Other side features include input validation and password protected features such 
as the ability to view records and delete all groups.
